## About Me

Environmental Data Scientist and PhD Candidate in Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University. I specialize in the intersection of ecology, geospatial analysis, and data science with a focus on Antarctic ecosystems.

## Technical Skills

- **Languages**: R, Python, SQL, Markdown
- **Software**: ArcGIS Suite, QGIS, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop
- **Technologies**: Remote Sensing, Machine Learning, Spatial Data Analysis, Image Classification, Bayesian Statistics

## Current Work

I'm currently developing computational pipelines to process ecological and geospatial data. My work involves using Machine Learning to understand and predict the impacts of climate change on Antarctic wildlife.

## Past Projects

As an Environmental Data Scientist and PhD Candidate in Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University, I bridge the gap between ecology, geospatial science, and data analytics. My focus is on Antarctic ecosystems, where I study the delicate interplay between indigenous species and their changing environment.
